grad = lambda x: np.array([x[0] - 2, x[1] - 1/2])
hess =  lambda x: np.eye(2)
# Define nonlinear constraint
c = lambda x: np.array([1/(x[0] + 1) - x[1],])
c_jac = lambda x: np.array([[-1/(x[0] + 1)**2, -1]])
c_hess = lambda x, v: 2*v[0]*np.array([[1/(x[0] + 1)**3, 0], [0, 0]])
nonlinear = NonlinearConstraint(c, ('greater', 1/4), c_jac, c_hess)

### ``minimize_constrained``

```
minimize_constrained(fun, x0, grad, hess='2-point', constraints=(),
                     method=None, xtol=1e-8, gtol=1e-8, sparse_jacobian=None,
                     options={}, callback=None, max_iter=1000, verbose=0)

    Minimize scalar function subject to constraints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        The objective function to be minimized.

            fun(x) -> float

        where x is an array with shape (n,).
    x0 : ndarray, shape (n,)
        Initial guess. Array of real elements of size (n,),
        where ``n`` is the number of independent variables.
    grad : callable
        Gradient of the objective function:

            grad(x) -> array_like, shape (n,)

        where x is an array with shape (n,).
    hess : {callable, '2-point', '3-point', 'cs', None}, optional
        Method for computing the Hessian matrix. The keywords
        select a finite difference scheme for numerical
        estimation. The scheme '3-point' is more accurate, but requires
        twice as much operations compared to '2-point' (default). The
        scheme 'cs' uses complex steps, and while potentially the most
        accurate, it is applicable only when `fun` correctly handles
        complex inputs and can be analytically continued to the complex
        plane. If it is a callable, it should return the 
        Hessian matrix of `dot(fun, v)`:

            hess(x, v) -> {LinearOperator, sparse matrix, ndarray}, shape (n, n)

        where x is a (n,) ndarray and v is a (m,) ndarray. When ``hess``
        is None it considers the hessian is an matrix filled with zeros.
    constraints : Constraint or List of Constraint's, optional
        A single object or a list of objects specifying
        constraints to the optimization problem.
        Available constraints are:

            - `BoxConstraint`
            - `LinearConstraint`
            - `NonlinearConstraint`

    method : {str, None}, optional
        Type of solver. Should be one of:

            - 'equality-constrained-sqp'
            - 'tr-interior-point'

        When None the more appropriate method is choosen.
        'equality-constrained-sqp' is chosen for problems that
        only have equality constraints and 'tr-interior-point'
        for general optimization problems.
    xtol : float, optional
        Tolerance for termination by the change of the independent variable.
        The algorithm will terminate when ``delta < xtol``, where ``delta``
        is the algorithm trust-radius. Default is 1e-8.
    gtol : float, optional
        Tolerance for termination by the norm of the Lagrangian gradient.
        The algorithm will terminate when both the infinity norm (i.e. max
        abs value) of the Lagrangian gradient and the constraint violation
        are smaller than ``gtol``. Default is 1e-8.
    sparse_jacobian : {bool, None}
        The algorithm uses a sparse representation of the Jacobian if True
        and a dense representation if False. When sparse_jacobian is None
        the algorithm uses the more convenient option, using a sparse
        representation if at least one of the constraint Jacobians are sparse
        and a dense representation when they are all dense arrays.
    options : dict, optional
        A dictionary of solver options. Available options include:

            initial_trust_radius: float
                Initial trust-region radius. By defaut uses 1.0, as
                suggested in [1]_, p.19, immediatly after algorithm III.
            initial_penalty : float
                Initial penalty for merit function. By defaut uses 1.0, as
                suggested in [1]_, p.19, immediatly after algorithm III.
            initial_barrier_parameter: float
                Initial barrier parameter. Exclusive for 'tr_interior_point'
                method. By default uses 0.1, as suggested in [1]_ immediatly
                after algorithm III, p. 19.
            initial_tolerance: float
                Initial subproblem tolerance. Exclusive for
                'tr_interior_point' method. By defaut uses 0.1,
                as suggested in [1]_ immediatly after algorithm III, p. 19.
            return_all : bool, optional
                When True return the list of all vectors
                through the iterations.
            factorization_method : string, optional
                Method used for factorizing the jacobian matrix.
                Should be one of:

                - 'NormalEquation': The operators
                   will be computed using the
                   so-called normal equation approach
                   explained in [1]_. In order to do
                   so the Cholesky factorization of
                   ``(A A.T)`` is computed. Exclusive
                   for sparse matrices. Requires
                   scikit-sparse installed.
                - 'AugmentedSystem': The operators
                   will be computed using the
                   so-called augmented system approach
                   explained in [1]_. It perform the
                   LU factorization of an augmented
                   system. Exclusive for sparse matrices.
                - 'QRFactorization': Compute projections
                   using QR factorization. Exclusive for
                   dense matrices.
                - 'SVDFactorization': Compute projections
                   using SVD factorization. Exclusive for
                   dense matrices.

                The factorization methods 'NormalEquation' and
                'AugmentedSystem' should be used only when
                ``sparse_jacobian=True``. They usually provide
                similar results. The methods 'QRFactorization'
                and 'SVDFactorization' should be used when
                ``sparse_jacobian=False``. By default uses
                'QRFactorization' for  dense matrices.
                The 'SVDFactorization' method can cope
                with Jacobian matrices with deficient row
                rank and will be used whenever other
                factorization methods fails (which may
                imply the conversion to a dense format).

    callback : callable, optional
        Called after each iteration:

            callback(OptimizeResult state) -> bool

        If callback returns True the algorithm execution is terminated.
        ``state`` is an `OptimizeResult` object, with the same fields
        as the ones from the return.
    max_iter : int, optional
        Maximum number of algorithm iterations. By default ``max_iter=1000``
    verbose : {0, 1, 2}, optional
        Level of algorithm's verbosity:

            * 0 (default) : work silently.
            * 1 : display a termination report.
            * 2 : display progress during iterations.

    Notes
    -----
    Method 'equality_constrained_sqp' is an implementation of
    Byrd-Omojokun Trust-Region SQP method described [3]_ and
    in [2]_, p. 549. It solves equality constrained equality
    constrained optimization problems by solving, at each substep,
    a trust-region QP subproblem. The inexact solution of these
    QP problems using projected CG method makes this method
    appropriate for large-scale problems.

    Method 'tr_interior_point' is an implementation of the
    trust-region interior point method described in [1]_.
    It solves general nonlinear by introducing slack variables
    and solving a sequence of equality-constrained barrier problems
    for progressively smaller values of the barrier parameter.
    The previously described equality constrained SQP method is used
    to solve the subproblems with increasing levels of accuracy as
    the iterate gets closer to a solution. It is also an
    appropriate method for large-scale problems.

### ``NonlinearConstraint``

```
NonlinearConstraint(fun, kind, jac, hess='2-point', enforce_feasibility=False)

   Nonlinear constraint

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        The function defining the constraint.

            fun(x) -> array_like, shape (m,)

        where x is a (n,) ndarray and ``m``
        is the number of constraints.
    kind : {str, tuple}
        Specifies the type of contraint. Options for this
        parameter are:

            - ('interval', lb, ub) for a constraint of the type:
                lb <= fun(x) <= ub
            - ('greater', lb) for a constraint of the type:
                fun(x) >= lb
            - ('less', ub) for a constraint of the type:
                fun(x) <= ub
            - ('equals', c) for a constraint of the type:
                fun(x) == c
            - ('greater',) for a constraint of the type:
                fun(x) >= 0
            - ('less',) for a constraint of the type:
                fun(x) <= 0
            - ('equals',) for a constraint of the type:
                fun(x) == 0

        where ``lb``,  ``ub`` and ``c`` are (m,) ndarrays or
        scalar values. In the latter case, the same value
        will be repeated for all the constraints.
    jac : callable
        Jacobian Matrix:

            jac(x) -> {ndarray, sparse matrix}, shape (m, n)

        where x is a (n,) ndarray.
    hess : {callable, '2-point', '3-point', 'cs', None}
        Method for computing the Hessian matrix. The keywords
        select a finite difference scheme for numerical
        estimation. The scheme '3-point' is more accurate, but requires
        twice as much operations compared to '2-point' (default). The
        scheme 'cs' uses complex steps, and while potentially the most
        accurate, it is applicable only when `fun` correctly handles
        complex inputs and can be analytically continued to the complex
        plane. If it is a callable, it should return the 
        Hessian matrix of `dot(fun, v)`:

            hess(x, v) -> {LinearOperator, sparse matrix, ndarray}, shape (n, n)

        where x is a (n,) ndarray and v is a (m,) ndarray. When ``hess``
        is None it considers the hessian is an matrix filled with zeros.
    enforce_feasibility : {list of boolean, boolean}, optional
        Specify if the constraint must be feasible along the iterations.
        If ``True``  all the iterates generated by the optimization
        algorithm need to be feasible in respect to a constraint. If ``False``
        this is not needed. A list can be passed to specify element-wise
        each constraints needs to stay feasible along the iterations and
        each does not. Alternatively, a single boolean can be used to
        specify the feasibility required of all constraints. By default it
        is False.

            - ('equals',) for a constraint of the type:
                A x == 0

        where ``lb``,  ``ub`` and ``c`` are (m,) ndarrays or
        scalar values. In the latter case, the same value
        will be repeated for all the constraints.
    enforce_feasibility : {list of boolean, boolean}, optional
        Specify if the constraint must be feasible along the iterations.
        If ``True``  all the iterates generated by the optimization

            - ('equals',) for a constraint of the type:
                x == 0

        where ``lb``,  ``ub`` and ``c`` are (m,) ndarrays or
        scalar values. In the latter case, the same value
        will be repeated for all the constraints.
    enforce_feasibility : {list of boolean, boolean}, optional
        Specify if the constraint must be feasible along the iterations.
        If ``True``  all the iterates generated by the optimization
        algorithm need to be feasible in respect to a constraint. If ``False``
        this is not needed. A list can be passed to specify element-wise
        each constraints needs to stay feasible along the iterations and
        each does not. Alternatively, a single boolean can be used to
        specify the feasibility required of all constraints. By default it
        is False.
